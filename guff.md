        <p>Helping organisations and technical teams work better by addressing organisational and technical debt with
            empirical, objective methods.</p>

        <h2>Help for CTO / Head of Engineering</h2>

        <p>Many jobs are important but not urgent. Many important jobs are also not full-time jobs. Many of these are
            the jobs that require something to be done, data capture, or waiting for time to pass before reviewing
            later. Other jobs are hard because they require work being done in ways that seem impossible.</p>

        <p>So how is that work going to get done? We all intend to prioritize mercilessly and get the important stuff
            done before it becomes a priority. The reality is that we spend time deciding what will not get done so that
            the things that need doing can be completed.</p>

        <h3>The Result</h3>
        <p>The result of this is that anything that won't fundamentally stop progress can't get prioritized.</p>

        <h3>The Cost</h3>
        <p>We lack information to make great decisions, we rely on intuition, and everything starts to slow down because
            all those things that we would like to have in place—so that our assumptions support our work—are lacking.
        </p>

        <p>We know what we want to have in place, we just don’t have the time or the people to put it in place.</p>

        <h2>We Can Help</h2>
        <p>There are many symptoms and opportunities. We have experience diagnosing and building plans for the
            following:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Hard to make objective decisions</strong> – Lack of observability because we don’t have the
                measures to support decision-making nor the infrastructure to produce them.</li>
            <li><strong>Slow, error-prone release processes</strong> – Lack of automation or test frameworks to make
                them efficient.</li>
            <li><strong>Business changes too fast</strong> – When gross lead time exceeds the time for the business to
                change its mind, it’s hard to get anything done!</li>
            <li><strong>Hard to make and then keep promises</strong> – Quality and feedback loops cause enormous amounts
                of time to vanish.</li>
            <li><strong>No buy-in for technical work</strong> – No time to write up the problems in a way that enables
                other stakeholders to clearly sign off on the work.</li>
            <li><strong>Fighting good decisions later</strong> – Structural problems exist but there’s no bandwidth to
                assign people to the work required to make safe changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Identifying developer time sinks</strong> – No time to build automation to improve the developer
                experience and lower cycle times.</li>
            <li><strong>Attrition rate and pay rises</strong> – Finding time to build career pathways is highly
                challenging.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>We have decades of experience with all of these problems at many scales. We know how hard it is to achieve
            these things because we have faced these problems ourselves—we wish we had someone to help. Many of these
            problems are not full-time jobs; they require touchpoints over time, iterative work, and review at later
            stages.</p>

        <p>The value of fixing or building a framework that enables teams to own this as part of their ways of working
            is enormous. The problem is that you don't have time to do it, and you cannot afford to put your team on it.
